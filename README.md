# Cryptography-DES-implement-in-C-
Cryptography- implementation of Data Encryption Standard(DES) in C

# Input format:
plaintext and cipher format - character in .txt file Base-16
E.g. 02468aceeca86420 (hex)  The content in plaintext.txt 
E.g. da02ce3a89ecac3b (hex)  The content in ciphertext.txt

The cipher.txt is the result of encryption on plaintext

The decrypted_plaintext is the result of decryption on cipher.tx

> The program is able to process 64bit and accept base-hex inputonly in this version,
